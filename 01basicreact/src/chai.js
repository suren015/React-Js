// Function name should be start with uppercase letter........Forced by JS library
function Chai() {
    return (
        <h1>Chai aur React..!!</h1>
    )
}
export default Chai


// Chai() is a component, whatever you used like vite or react ..... u should be named component as Uppercase letter
// Good Practices is that u should write ur file name started with capital letter

// We have used two libraries:: 1) React-Js and 2) Vite+React

// if u return html codes then you should write file name as .jsx else u write .js
